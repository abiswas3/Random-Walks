{{< remark>}}
**Disclaimer:** In compiling this list, we have endeavoured to achieve the impossible -- that of separating the art from the artist. We neither know nor concern ourselves with the personal lives of those listed below. 
Our only criterion for selection was that their music brought us enormous joy at some point in our lives.

# The Lockdown Music Project

Over lockdown [David Smith](https://phys.washington.edu/people/david-p-smith) *(a.k.a Dancing Dave)* and I decided that the best way to pass the time would be to discover new music. 
Thus, over a few virtual zoom pints, we came up with the <u>"Lockdown Music Project"</u>. 
The task is simple --  **For every year starting from 1960, to all the way to 1990, you need to select one album that means something to you**.
We emphasize that the criterion for selection is <u>the effect an album has had on you as a person</u>, and not if it was previously included in some poorly compiled list by the Rolling Stones Magazine[^a]. 
The goal is not to find the most popular songs of the year. For that, we already have Wikipedia! 
We'd like to know what albums stirred something deep within you. 
There is no right or wrong answer here. Quoting the great [Leonard Cohen](assets/LockdownMusicProject/LC-quote.jpg):

{{< quote >}}
Music is like bread. It is one of the fundamental nourishments that we have available, and there are many different varieties and degrees and grades.
A song that is useful, that touches somebody, must be measured by that utility alone. 'Cheap music' is an uncharitable description. 
If it touches you, it's not cheap. From a certain point of view, all our emotions are cheap, but those are the only ones we've got. 
It's loneliness and longing and desire and celebration.
Mathematics is the music of reason.

-- Leonard Cohen 
{{< /quote >}}

[^a]: This is our way of telling you that you should not just Google best songs in Year X to fill out your list.

**Example**:
If you think no album had a more profound effect on
your teenage years than Rubber Soul, then go ahead and pick Rubber
Soul by the Beatles[^b] for the year of 1965. 

{{< alert >}}
But here is the catch! Once you pick an album for an artist, you cannot use the same artist for any other year again. 
{{</alert >}}

This means that you cannot use Abbey Road for the
 year 1969 or any Beatles album again (considering you picked Rubber Soul for 1965).[^d]
As there are a lot of years between 1960 and 1990, we decided to split
the workload. Smith helped pick the even years, and I picked albums
for the odd ones. 

[^b]:  We will allow you to differentiate between a George Harrison solo album and a Beatles album. They are not the same.

[^d]: This rule prevents Ari from just putting Springsteen down 5 times and Smith from putting Bob down 8 times.


## 1960: At Last by Etta James {.dave}

I must admit that I was a bit of a novice on the albums released in
the year that started one of the greatest decades in music
history. Notable giants such as Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Joan Baez
all appeared but I decided on Etta James‚Äô At Last. Named after one of
the most iconic tracks in popular music, the album is a testament to
the powerhouse vocals of one of the great RnB artists. The opening
track ‚ÄúAnything To Say You‚Äôre Mine‚Äù immediately draws you in, and the
album includes a great cover of Muddy Waters‚Äô ‚ÄúI Just Want to Make
Love to You‚Äù - a bold cover given the era. I also liked ‚ÄúTrust in Me.‚Äù
Listed as the seventh track, and the song for which the album takes
its name, there may be little doubt that ‚ÄúAt Last‚Äù can be included in
the conversation of one of the greatest records of all time. A track
that is timeless.


## 1961 Lonley And Blue, Roy Orbison{.ari}

Already, we have a slight dilemma. 
As discussed earlier, the point of the game is to list the album that left a real imprint on you.
In 1961, John Coltrane released My Favourite Things and Roy Orbison released Lonely and Blue.
I absolutely love Roy's singing on this record (even [Bruce agrees](https://youtu.be/Wv8p5aK-CGE?feature=shared&t=162)).
On the other hand, John Coltrane is one of my biggest musical heroes, and in my opinion John's best album is a Love Supreme (but, 1965 is already spoken for).
Not including John here, means the list might not include John Coltrane at all; which seems blasphemous to say the least.
John Coltrane has most definitely left a long lasting impact on me, and even help curate my taste in music. 
So even though I'd pick John Coltrane every time over Roy Orbison for [desert island discs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM9F-3JuKvU), in 1961, Roy Orbison sang for me and the lonely. That is the game :-)

The hallmark of this album is its simplicity and his operatic voice.
Perfect for putting on a cold winter English evening while finishing up an unfinished manuscript.
The album starts with an all time classic, played in numerous movies, with only the lonely.
I never skip over any song when listening to this record.
Finally, with here comes that song the album finishes just as strongly as it started. 

 **Notable Mentions**

+  My Favourite Things, John Coltrane: Just listen to the opening [from 0:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-81BzBWGXZM&t=46s), and tell me he is not the GOAT üêê.
+  The Genius Sings The Blues - Ray Charles
+ Jimmy Reed At Carnegie Hall - Jimmy Reed
+ Aretha - Aretha Franklin

## 1962: Pot Luck, Elvis Presley {.dave}

What music list would be complete without The King! A voice and
personality bigger than life itself. Suspicion stood out as one of my
favorite tracks (a theme that would of course appear in one of his
biggest hits Suspicious Minds). Enjoyed Gonna Get Back Somehow and
Night Rider.


## 1963: Samba Esquema Novo, Jorge Ben Jor {.ari}

One of life's unfulfilled dreams was to watch Jorge play in Rio. 
In my opinion [Mas Que Nada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd3LEsKIjNI) should be in the list of best 100 songs ever written (and this list would include Ode To Joy and Nessun Dorma).
Jorge is only non-English speaking musician on my list (though this perhaps speaks to my limited taste), and on many rainy Oxford mornings, Jorge's music teleports me to the beaches of Rio, where I pretend to live the life he so joyfully sings about.
You have to be special to keep James Brown from making the list and Jorge Ben Jor is a little more than special.

**Notable Mentions**

+ James Brown, Live At The Apollo

## 1964: Ain‚Äôt That Good News, Sam Cooke {.dave}

Another voice of a generation and a giant of the 60‚Äôs RnB sound. I would make a solid guess that the album‚Äôs track No.7, A Change is Gonna Come is likely among many music fans‚Äô greatest songs that have ever been written. The transition of speaking about hardship ‚ÄúIt's been too hard living, But I'm afraid to die‚Äù to redemption ‚ÄúOh, there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long, But now I think I'm able, to carry on‚Äù  


## 1965: Bringing It Back Home, Bob Dylan  {.ari}

In my opinion, there is no one above Bob! He is untouchable and one of two artists (see year 1975) that could keep *A Love Supreme* off this list. While
there is little debate that Bob was surely going to feature on this
list, I am tasked with the impossible problem of picking my favourite
Dylan album.  In a career that‚Äôs spanned over 50 years, how do you
decide which is his greatest album?  You could say that *Blonde on
Blonde* was when he was at his poetic best. Any record that includes
*Visions of Johanna* and *Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands* should be an
automatic qualifier.  You could also argue that the [social frenzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6emQIze6k9M)
surrounding his comeback album *Blood on Tracks* best represents Dylan
the person. *Highway 61* makes nearly every top 10 list on the
internet, and there is a reason it does so. I can even make a case for
*A Free Wheelin Bob Dylan*- does not have a single bad song!  Despite
being spoiled for choices, I'm going with *Bringing It Back Home*.  It
was the first time Bob went electric. It best represents what I think
is his single most defining character. Just when you think you know
Bob Dylan, he confirms that you really don't.
And did I mention that this record has *It's Alright Ma, I'm only Bleeding* on Side A. What to me is his best song ever.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ Rubber Soul by The Beatles
+ A Love Supreme by John Coltrane 
+ My Generation by the Who
+ Mr Tambourine Man by the Byrds

## 1966: {.dave}

## 1967: Songs Of Leonard Cohen {.ari}

I was introduced to this album by the owner of [Indie
Coffee](https://www.indiecoffee.net/index.html), a small cafe on
Regent Street in Madison, Wisconsin. She used to play this album on
repeat every evening, 30 minutes befor close. 
This album was my introduction to Leonard Cohen and it has stuck with me every since. 
Leonard perhaps more than any other artist on this list (even Bob), to me, has a mystique that I cannot put into words.
Specially during one of his [last live performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=251Blni2AE4) in London.
This was one of the first albums I put on this list. Side B of this record is one of my favourite Side B's of any record ever. 
The album starts with an [all time classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF3SJerPG7g), but it goes to the legendary category once [So Long Marianne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ACgCmBubb4) and [Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzgUs3c9QHY) come on.
While impossible to believe, given his fame, fortune and legacy, I believe Leonard Cohen was underrated (if you know what I mean).
If Bob Dylan did not exist, one could make a [case](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/forget-bob-dylan-leonard-cohen-first-songwriter-win-nobel-prize-literature/) for Leonard winning the Nobel prize.

**Notable Mentions**

+ Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles
+ The Doors, The Doors
+ Surrealistic Pillow, Jefferson Airplane
+ Something Else, The Kinks
+ Between The Buttons, The Rolling Stones

## 1968: {.dave}

## 1969: Abbey Road, The Beatles {.ari}


Finally we get to the Beatles!
As I've gotten older, my love for the Beatles has surprisingly faded. 
That being said, during my university years they were a huge part of my life, and I still enjoy listening to them.
Perhaps their fame does their music a disservice.
So for the role they played in my life, and how many hours I've spent listening to them, I must include the Beatles.
I always thought George Harrison was the most interesting Beatle, and thus, the album that makes my list is Abbey Road. 
George was given the most freedom as a writer - he wrote
*Here Comes The Sun* and *Something* which remain two of my favourite Beatles tracks.
I did have a hard time picking between Revolver and Abbey Road, as in Revolver the Beatles were at their experimental best. 
However as Abbey Road has two Harrison Songs and a vintage McCartney singing a 16 minute medley of his nursery rhymes (to perfection I might add) -- I'm happy to go with Abbey Road as my Beatles pick.

**PS:** When I first moved to London, I lived in West Hampstead, one street off the main road on which the famous Abbey Road Studios is located. I ran past this studio nearly every day for an entire year.

**Notable Mentions**

+ Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Neil Young and The Crazy Horse
+ Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin
+ Let It Bleed, The Rolling Stones
+ The Band, The Band
+ Crosby Stills and Nash, Crosby Stills and Nash
+ Santana, Santa
+ Space Oddity, David Bowie
+ Songs From A Room, Leonard Cohen: The Opening song bird on a wire, and the ending song Tonight will be fine are immortal for me.


## 1970: {.dave}

## 1971: Led Zeppelin IV, Led Zeppelin  {.ari}

Rock'N Roll hall of fame! There are no two ways about this album. 
I'm convinced Robert Plant spent most of his musical career doing one of the two 
things: 

1. Telling us he possesses divine knowledge about the mysteries of life that us ordinary mortals do not with the lyrics to  *Stairway To Heaven* 
2. Making Sex noises. 

To me, and for a lot of people I know, Led Zeppelin **is** Rock 'n Roll.
No band exemplified the adrenaline rush and pure excess of rock n roll through their music like Led Zeppelin did.
Given this is how I feel about them, and with the competition for spots heating up, we picked the album with their most defining work and went with it.

**Notable Mentions**:

+ Electric Warrior, T-Rex 
+ Sticky Fingers, The Rolling Stones -- It kills me to not include a record that includes Wild Horses, which is my favourite stones song ever. I mulled over this for such a long time.

## 1972: {.dave}


## 1973: The Dark Side Of The Moon, Pink Floyd {.ari}

The lyrics of *Time* give still me the heebie jeebies. 
I expect many music fans have had a few sleepless nights contemplating the lyrics of this album.
And the dark mood continues with *Us and Them* and *Money*. 
Find me someone who has spent 4 years at an American university without spotting a Dark Side Of The Moon poster on a dorm wall. 
Additionally, they were Cambridge boys and having spent a good bit of time in the same pubs as they started, I include them as my pick for 1973.

PS: There are a few performances where I think the artist was touched
by God. 
In [Pompei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTseTg48568), Gilmour was not one of us.

## 1974: {.dave}

## 1975: Born To Run, Bruce Springsteen and The E-Street Band{.ari}

Stuck on a deserted island with only one item of my choice -- I'd pick this album.
Let it be the last thing I listen to before I leave this earth.
The only absolute non-negotiable on this list. 
Everything about this record, starting from record cover with Bruce and Clarence spread out across the two sides, the longing for life to be more than what it is, their orchestra like music filling the room, all the way to Clarence's solo in Jungleland -- it is perfection!
Thunder Road is, according to me [(this live version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDIDawmeeI0&pp=ygUSbnJ1Y2UgdGhpbmdlciByb2Fk), the greatest song ever written. 
If this [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv8p5aK-CGE) does not make you want to *roll down your window, and let the wind blow back your hair*, I don't know what will (just read the [comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv8p5aK-CGE) if you're having a hard day).
He's had me chasing the feeling for over 12 years, and I still cannot get enough of the Boss!


<!-- <img src="assets/LockdownMusicProject/BornToRun.jpg" alt="Image" style="width: 650px; height: 500px;"> -->


**Notable Mentions:** 

+ Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd
+ Blood On Tracks by Bob Dylan
+ A Night At The Opera by the Queen
+ Fleetwood Mac(1975) by Fleetwood Mac

## 1976: {.dave}

## 1977: Rumours, Fleetwood Mac {.ari}

If you‚Äôve ever searched for this album on YouTube, chances are you‚Äôve stumbled upon a comment that says, ```There is literally not a single bad or even mediocre song on this album.``` And honestly, it's hard to argue with that.
What makes this record even more remarkable is the chaos that surrounded its creation. 
To write a record like this while nearly every member of the band was either sleeping with each other, or not speaking to one another because they had slept together, makes the album even more incredible.
There are rumours of the band members coming into the studio at separate times to avoid being around other members.
How did such beauty came out of such toxicity?

**PS:** If we'd gone past the 90's I would have included Hot Fuss
by the Killers in the same category of every song is gold.

## 1978: {.dave}

## 1979: London Calling, The Clash {.ari}

Another great year of music with lots of good records. So many good
artists did so much of their good work in this era. I must admit, I'm
particularly biased towards the late sixties and seventies in my
taste.  It was hard to decide. MJ was on the scene. AC/DC came up with
Highway to Hell. Pink Floyd released the Wall. In the end, for how
iconic the album still is, and for how many times I've listened to it,
I went with the Clash. The were pioneers of a genre and this was
without doubt their most iconic album.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ The Wall, Pink Floyd
+ Off The Wall, Michael Jackson
+ Highway To Hell, AC/DC
+ Into The Music, Van Morrison
+ Live Rust, Neil Young and The Crazy Horse (just for Hey, hey, my, my -- rock'n roll may never die)

## 1980: Back In Black, AC/DC {.dave}

I think I can credit both AC/DC and Metallica as the major inspiration
to play guitar. Once you hear those Malcom and Angus Young riff‚Äôs, you
just want to pick up the guitar to replicate that sound! This album is
stacked with some of the finest classic rock/metal tracks ever
written - ‚ÄúShoot to Thrill‚Äù, ‚ÄúHells Bells‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou Shook Me All Night
Long‚Äù and the title track ‚ÄúBack in Black‚Äù. I can‚Äôt imagine the list
being complete without these hall of famers and the guitarist that
made the Gibson SG iconic!

**Notable mentions:**

+ Remain in Light - Talking Heads, 
+ The River - Bruce Springsteen

## 1981: Moving Pictures, Rush {.ari}

I have to be honest, I was quite indifferent about this year. In the
end I gave in to my selection as Rush had three songs (Tom Sawyer,
Limelight, YYZ) I really liked on one record and I couldn't find a
better alternative. It's a bit lazy I know, but the Canadians will
tell you it's the most iconic album ever made. I could have included
the Cure here but then it would force me to not include what I think
is there best record later.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ Faith, The Cure

## 1982: Thriller, Michael Jackson ?? {.dave}

## 1983: Let's Dance, David Bowie{.ari}

Every time I watch Bowie perform live on YouTube I just cannot take my
eyes off him. The man was born to perform on stage. With the 80's a
stacked as they are, I had to find room for Ziggy. I think there is
something mysterious about his personality, something I cannot
explain, that makes his songs better than they actually are. The
stories about he helped young musicians later in life just add to his
legend. David Bowie did not die, the starman just went home!

**Notable Mentions:**

+ Pyromania, Deff Leppard
+ War, U2
+ The Final Cut, Pink Floyd

## 1984: Purple Rain ??{.dave}

## 1985: Brothers In Arms, Dire Straits {.ari}

In my opinion, Mark Knofler is one of the most underrated musicians in
the UK. This album is one of my favourite records of all time. Period!
One of the those albums, I put on here before I even began researching
this task. PS: I've run a half marathon listening to *Walk Of Life* on
repeat.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ Hounds Of Love, Kate Bush (Guilty Pleasure) 

## 1986: The Queen Is Dead, The Smiths{.dave}

Morissey singing about heartbreak and Johnny Marr doing just about
anything! We could never look past the Smiths! Too many nights at
spent in Karaoke bars in Seattle, trying to emulate the Smiths.


## 1987: Joshua Tree, U2 {.ari}

This might be controversial, as the same year, Guns N' Roses released
*An Appetite For Destruction*. A record that included Sweet Child Of
Mine, Paradise City and Welcome to the Jungle. It's hard to argue
against the decision to put Gun's N Roses for this year. Unfortunately
for them, U2 released Joshua Tree the same year. As annoying as Bono
is, I've spent more time listening to U2 than Guns N' Roses. The
record includes *Where the Streets Have No Name*, *With or Without You*
and *I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For* is hard to
ignore. Perhaps I am a little bit biased but I'll rarely pick against
the Irish.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ An Appetite For Destruction, Guns N' Roses
+ Sign 'O' The Times, Prince
+ Strangeways, Here We Come, The Smiths


## 1988: {.dave}

## 1989: Disintegration, The Cure {.ari}

I'd have put this record on this list just for *Pictures Of
You*. Listened to it on repeat on my first year in Wisconsin. Got me
through some really cold winters. Homesick and Lullaby were
particularly good too. One of the mainstays of the punk and new wave
movement, the Cure has a special place in my heart.

**Notable Mentions:**

+ The Stone Roses, The Stone Roses 
+
